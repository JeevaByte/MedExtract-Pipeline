Dear Diabetes Specialist Team,

RE: URGENT REFERRAL - Type 2 Diabetes Management

Patient Details:
Name: John Smith
Date of Birth: 14th July 1982 (Age 41)
NHS Number: NHS001234
Contact: 07700 900123

Clinical Summary:
Mr. Smith is a 41-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. He was diagnosed 3 years ago and has been managed in primary care with oral hypoglycemic agents.

Current Medications:
- Metformin 500mg BD (Twice daily)
- Lisinopril 10mg OD (For hypertension)

Recent Investigations:
- HbA1c: 9.2% (77 mmol/mol) - Date: 10/01/2024
- Fasting Glucose: 12.4 mmol/L
- Blood Pressure: 145/92 mmHg
- BMI: 32.5
- eGFR: 75 ml/min (Stage 2 CKD)

Symptoms:
- Polyuria and polydipsia
- Fatigue
- Blurred vision (intermittent)
- Weight loss of 5kg over last 2 months

Co-morbidities:
- Hypertension (diagnosed 2021)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Obesity (BMI 32.5)

Social History:
- Non-smoker (ex-smoker, quit 2019)
- Alcohol: 10 units per week
- Occupation: Office worker (sedentary)

Reason for Referral:
Despite optimal oral therapy and lifestyle advice, Mr. Smith's glycemic control remains suboptimal. His HbA1c has increased from 7.8% to 9.2% over the past 6 months. He is now developing early diabetic complications with microalbuminuria detected on recent urinalysis.

I would be grateful for your specialist assessment and advice on:
1. Optimization of diabetic management (possible insulin initiation)
2. Cardiovascular risk assessment
3. Screening for diabetic complications (retinopathy, nephropathy)
4. Dietary and lifestyle intervention support

Urgency: Routine appointment within 4 weeks

Many thanks for your assistance.

Kind regards,

Dr. Sarah Thompson MBChB MRCGP
